# Quick Start Guide - IPO Day-1 Trading Strategy

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Strategy (5 minutes)

Read `README.md` to understand:
- How the two-phase approach works
- Pre-IPO analysis → Day-1 execution
- Expected returns and risks

### Step 2: Collect Historical Data (2-3 weeks)

Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 1:
- Collect 300-500 historical IPOs (2015-2024)
- Download S-1 filings from SEC EDGAR
- Extract fundamentals, deal characteristics, sentiment
- Calculate 30-day returns (target variable)

**Shortcut:** Start with 100 IPOs from 2023-2024 for a minimum viable model

### Step 3: Train Model (1 day)

Run `research.ipynb`:
1. Load historical data
2. Train LightGBM classifier
3. Validate (target AUC > 0.70)
4. Save model to Object Store

**Output:** Trained model that predicts IPO success probability

### Step 4: Score Upcoming IPOs (Weekly, 2-3 hours)

Every Monday:
1. Check IPO calendar (Renaissance Capital, Nasdaq)
2. Download S-1 filings for upcoming IPOs
3. Extract features using `ipoanalyzer.py`
4. Score with trained model
5. Update `data/ipo_calendar.csv`
6. Upload to QuantConnect Object Store

**Output:** CSV with IPO scores for next 30 days

### Step 5: Deploy & Trade (Automated)

1. Upload to QuantConnect:
   - `main.py`
   - `ipocalendar.py`
   - `ipoanalyzer.py`

2. Configure parameters:
   - `score_threshold = 0.70`
   - `max_positions = 5`
   - `holding_period = 30`

3. Run backtest → Paper trade → Go live

**Output:** Automated trading of high-conviction IPOs

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient training data** → Collect at least 200 IPOs
2. **Overfitting** → Use proper train/test split (80/20)
3. **Ignoring slippage** → IPOs gap at open, use limit orders
4. **Overtrading** → Stick to score > 0.70 threshold
5. **Forgetting to update calendar** → Weekly discipline required

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small:** Begin with 2024 data (50-100 IPOs) for quick MVP
2. **Focus on tech IPOs:** They have more predictable patterns
3. **Track lock-up dates:** Calendar reminder 5 days before expiration
4. **Use alerts:** Set up email alerts when new IPOs price
5. **Document everything:** Keep notes on each trade for learning

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Issue: Can't find S-1 filings**
→ Search SEC EDGAR by company name, not ticker

**Issue: Model AUC < 0.65**
→ Need more data or better features (add more sentiment sources)

**Issue: No IPOs this week**
→ Normal! IPO market has dry spells, be patient

**Issue: Large slippage on entry**
→ Increase limit order buffer to 3-5% above market

**Issue: QuantConnect import errors**
→ Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
